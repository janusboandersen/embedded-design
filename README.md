# Design of embedded systems using SOCs, FPGAs and SBCs
This repo contains files from various projects from the courses E2DEL, E3ISD1 and E4ISD2 (Indlejret Systemdesign - design of embedded systems).
The courses use
- Freedom KL25Z board from NXP with a Kinetis SOC based on the Arm Cortex M0+ core
- The Arty A7 FPGA board with the Artix-7 FPGA
- The PocketBeagle SBC using the Sitara AM335x processor

The pdf files contain the main report/journals, documenting the methods, design, results and learnings/future improvements.
