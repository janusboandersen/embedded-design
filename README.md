# Design of embedded systems using SOCs, FPGAs and SBCs
This repo contains code, designs and reports/journals from various projects from the courses:
- E2DEL (Digital Elektronik - digital electronics),
- E3ISD1 and E4ISD2 (Indlejret Systemdesign - design of embedded systems), and
- E4BIS (Brugeroplevelser i Indlejrede Systemer - user experience with embedded systems).

Hardware used is:
1. Freedom KL25Z board from NXP with a Kinetis SOC based on the Arm Cortex M0+ core, bare-metal and with FreeRTOS.
2. The Arty A7 FPGA board with the Artix-7 FPGA.
3. The PocketBeagle SBC using the Sitara AM335x processor, running headless Debian Linux.
- Various additional off-the-shelf components.

Key concepts and technologies are:
- Development based on system requiremenents.
1. SOC-related:
 * Programming for the M0+ ISA using the CMSIS Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)
 * Using interrupts efficiently
 * Using peripherals efficiently (DMA, Timers, ADC, DAC, SPI, GPIO, etc.)
 * Programming for real-time systems using FreeRTOS
 * Mainly C-programming.
2. FPGA-related:
 * Designing synchronous systems with clocked design and finite state-machines (FSM, FSMD)
 * Describing hardware using VHDL
 * Concurrent co-design of hardware and software.
3. SBC-related:
 * Systems Programming
 * Network programming
 * Client-server architecture
 * Using Sitara peripherals, e.g. programmable realtime units (PRU), CAN-bus interface (and SocketCAN), etc.
 * Interfacing with the physical world via sensors and regulators
 * Mainly C++ programming (Modern C++, so in the style of C++11, C++14, C++17).

The pdf files in each folder are the main reports/journals, documenting the methods, design, results and learnings/future improvements.
