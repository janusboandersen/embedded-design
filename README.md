# Design of embedded systems using SOCs, FPGAs and SBCs
This repo contains code, designs and reports/journals from various projects from the courses:
- E2DEL (Digital Elektronik - digital electronics),
- E3ISD1 and E4ISD2 (Indlejret Systemdesign - design of embedded systems).

The courses use:
- Freedom KL25Z board from NXP with a Kinetis SOC based on the Arm Cortex M0+ core
- The Arty A7 FPGA board with the Artix-7 FPGA
- The PocketBeagle SBC using the Sitara AM335x processor

The pdf files contain the main report/journals, documenting the methods, design, results and learnings/future improvements.
